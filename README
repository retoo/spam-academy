The Spam Academy script lets your IMAP user to train your 
Spamasassin Bayes filter.

The script works like.
 1. Iterate over all folders in /home/
    2. See if there's a .spam_academy flag file in the users folder
    3. if not the script continues with the next folder 
    4. the script then setuid's to this user
    5. if not already existing it creates a folder structure in 
       the users folders:
        SA/{Ham,Spam}/{todo,done}
        (the current version uses german names)
    6. all mails in Ham/todo are feeded to sa-learn --ham and 
       then moved to the done folder
    7. all mails in Spam/todo are feeded to spamassassin -r 
       and then moved to the done folder
    8. logs are being kept in $HOME/.sa/log/

The script is not yet finished!
